# Developed a Python program to simulate car acceleration and braking using object-oriented programming principles. 
# Designed a system where users input the carâ€™s year, make, and initial speed, as well as the number of acceleration and braking cycles. 
# Implemented dynamic speed adjustments with constraints (e.g., max speed of 120 mph), real-time updates after each operation, and input validation to ensure accurate user interactions.
